# Youth Sport-Related Injury Analysis
## Overview
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), there were 131.3 million visits to the Emergency Department (E.D.) in 2020 and 38 million trips were injury related. The USA Department of Health and Human Services' *2021 Trends in the Utilization of Emergency Department Services between 2009-2018* report to congress efforts to discourage the overuse of Emergency Departments. We aim to support hospitals by educating patients, parents, and coaches on the "non-emergency" or "inappropriate" use of E.D. resources. Our plan is to create an injury management plan to optimize healthcare resources and highlight superusers who use the E.D. visit the E.D. more frequently.

Our target demographic is youth who visited the E.D. for sport-related injuries. The World Health Organization and the United Nations define 'youth' as those persons between the ages of 15 and 24 years. The definition of youth may change with circumstances; demographic, financial, economic and socio-cultural settings. However, the definition that uses 15-24 age cohort as youth appropriatly describes people who benefit from guideance as they transition from the dependence of childhood to adulthoodâ€™s independence. The youth

By analyzing this demopgraphics we hope to determine trends over the past ten years with youth E.D. visits  inregards to sport-related injuries. We are analying into E.D. visits that were due to concussions, sprains, broken bones/fractures, dislocations in track and field, soccer, and basketball, gymnastics at school/daycare or recreation sports field.Based on th Ncsa College Recruiting organization the top highschools sports played by both male and female are tracka nd field,  soccer, and basketball. We believe narrowing the sports played will allow us to maximize our research efforts. 

We are quiering data over a 10 year span from 2009 to 2019 from the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEIISS) Database.

Hypotheis outh will better plan for future situations by analyzing the risks and being more suspectable to change in the present with the myelination helps provide the foundation for brain connectivity and supports the emergence of cognitive and behavioral functioning complete except for prefrontal lobe in the stages of of maturation cognitive and emotional growth.

### Technology, Languages, and Tools
#### National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS) Database
For over 45 years, the CPSC has operated a statistically valid injury surveillance and follow-back system known as the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS). The primary purpose of NEISS is to collect data on consumer product-related injuries occurring in the United States. CPSC uses these data to produce nationwide estimates of product-related injuries.

NEISS is based on a nationally representative probability sample of U.S. hospitals and territories. Each participating NEISS hospital reports patient information for every emergency department visit associated with a consumer product or a poisoning. They have become an important public health research tool for CPSC, researchers, and consumers throughout the United States and worldwide. In 2000, CPSC expanded NEISS to collect data on all injuries for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention through an interagency agreement. The next major update to NEISS occurred in 2018 with seven new variables: Diagnosis_2, Other_Diagnosis_2, Body_Part_2, Product_3, Ethnicity, Alcohol_Involved, and Drug_Involved. In addition to the new variables, the maximum length of the Narrative text was increased from 142 to 400 characters. These changes were effective, starting with the treatment date of January 1, 2019.
