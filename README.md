# Youth Sport-Related Injury Analysis
## Overview
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), there were 131.3 million visits to the Emergency Department (E.D.) in 2020 and 38 million trips were injury related. The USA Department of Health and Human Services' *2021 Trends in the Utilization of Emergency Department Services between 2009-2018* report awares congress of the misuse of E.D. resources for "non-emergency" or "inappropriate" visits. Our plan is to highlight statistical findings to support a proposed injury management plan for patients, parents, and coaches. Our hope is to support hospitals and optimize healthcare resources.

Our target demographic are youth who visited the E.D. for sport-related injuries. The World Health Organization and the United Nations define 'youth' as those persons between the ages of 15 and 24 years. The definition of youth may change with circumstances: demographic, financial, economic and socio-cultural settings. However, the definition that uses 15-24 age cohort as youth appropriatly describes people who benefit from guideance as they transition from the dependence of childhood to adulthoodâ€™s independence. Our objective is to focus on the most popular sports played by males and females according to the National Federation of State High School Associations: track and field, basketball, and soccer. We are analyzing E.D. visits that were due to concussions, sprains, fractures, dislocations at schools, daycares or recreation sports fields. By analzying specific sports and injuries, we hope to find significant, statistical findings to guide an injury management plan. We are quiering data over a 10 year span from 2009 to 2019 from the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEIISS) Database. 

**Our hypothesis are that most E.D. visits are minors under the age of 18 who do not require hospitalization or are not transferred to a different department.** This target audience would benefit from an injury management plan that utilizes other healthcare resources.

#### National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS) Database
For over 45 years, the CPSC has operated a statistically valid injury surveillance and follow-back system known as the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS). The primary purpose of NEISS is to collect data on consumer product-related injuries occurring in the United States. CPSC uses these data to produce nationwide estimates of product-related injuries.

NEISS is based on a nationally representative probability sample of U.S. hospitals and territories. Each participating NEISS hospital reports patient information for every emergency department visit associated with a consumer product or a poisoning. They have become an important public health research tool for CPSC, researchers, and consumers throughout the United States and worldwide. In 2000, CPSC expanded NEISS to collect data on all injuries for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention through an interagency agreement. The next major update to NEISS occurred in 2018 with seven new variables: Diagnosis_2, Other_Diagnosis_2, Body_Part_2, Product_3, Ethnicity, Alcohol_Involved, and Drug_Involved. In addition to the new variables, the maximum length of the Narrative text was increased from 142 to 400 characters. These changes were effective, starting with the treatment date of January 1, 2019.

## Summary
If a person could die or be permanently disabled, it is an emergency. For the purpose of our study the following are reasons to visit the E.D.:
- Injury to the head with passing out, fainting, or confusion, 
- Injury to neck or spine, particularly if there is loss of feeling or inability to move
- Severe chest pain or pressure
- Seizures
- Trouble breathing, passing out, fainting, 
- Pain in the arm or jaw
- Unusual or bad headache, particularly if it started suddenly
- Suddenly not able to speak, see, walk, or move, 
- Suddenly weak or drooping on one side of the body
- Dizziness or weakness that does not go away
- Sudden confusion
- Heavy bleeding
- Possible broken bone, loss of movement, particularly if the bone is pushing through the skin
- Deep wound
- Coughing or throwing up blood
- Severe pain anywhere on the body
- High fever with headache and stiff neck
- High fever that does not get better with medicine
- Throwing up or loose stools that does not stop
### Injury Management Plan

#### Strength
#### Limitations
We are not medical professionals that can determine which injures are deemed "inappriopraite" or "non-emergency".
#### Future Finding
1) Does wieght/BMI play a role in increase emergency visits
2) Who brough patient into hospital
3) Medical Education of patient and parent
4) Wait time of patients at the hospical

# Project Management
Our team was split into to departments: Analytical and Data Wrangling and Visualization Team.
#### Analytical Team
The Analytical Team's role is to narrow down selected topic and determine the reasonings for for research proposals. We determine the datasource used for our analysis. Our goal was to  project
The selected topic and the reasoning for that selection.
A description of the data source.
The questions that the team planned to answer with the data.
Most analytics teams will focus on: Building big data collection and analytics capabilities to uncover customer, product, and operational insights. Analyzing data sources and proposing solutions to strategic planning problems on a one-time or periodic basis. Providing data-driven decision support
