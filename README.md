# Youth Sport-Related Injury Analysis
## Overview
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), there were 131.3 million visits to the Emergency Department (E.D.) in 2020, and 38 million trips were injury related. The USA Department of Health and Human Services 2021 Trends in the Utilization of Emergency
Department Services, 2009-2018 report to congress describe efforts to discourage the overuse of Emergency Departments. 

Our mission is to analyze Sport-Related Injury Analysis for youth. The World Health Organisation and the United Nations define 'youth' as those persons between the ages of 15 and 24 years. We aim to support hospitals by educating patients, parents, and coaches on the "non-emergency" or "inappropriate" use of E.D. resources. Our education plan wants to encourage patients, guardians, and coaches to be aware of injury statistics in sports in hopes of creating an injury management plan to utilize primary care services. In addition, we want to focus on superusers who use the E.D. more frequently.

The hospital aims to educate parents and coaches on sports-related injuries where people between the ages of 14 and 24 end up in the hospital due to concussions, sprains, broken bones/fractures, dislocations in track and field, soccer, and basketball, gymnastics at school/daycare or recreation sports field.

## National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS) Database
For over 45 years, the CPSC has operated a statistically valid injury surveillance and follow-back system known as the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS). The primary purpose of NEISS is to collect data on consumer product-related injuries occurring in the United States. CPSC uses these data to produce nationwide estimates of product-related injuries.

NEISS is based on a nationally representative probability sample of U.S. hospitals and territories. Each participating NEISS hospital reports patient information for every emergency department visit associated with a consumer product or a poisoning to a child younger than five. 

NEISS has become an important public health research tool for CPSC, researchers, and consumers throughout the United States and worldwide. In 2000, CPSC expanded NEISS to collect data on all injuries for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention through an interagency agreement. The next major update to NEISS occurred in 2018 with seven new variables: Diagnosis_2, Other_Diagnosis_2, Body_Part_2, Product_3, Ethnicity, Alcohol_Involved, and Drug_Involved. In addition to the new variables, the maximum length of the Narrative text was increased from 142 to 400 characters. These changes were effective, starting with the treatment date of January 1, 2019.
