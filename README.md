# Youth Sport-Related Injury Analysis
## Overview
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), there were 131.3 million visits to the Emergency Department (E.D.) in 2020, and 38 million trips were injury related. The USA Department of Health and Human Services' 2021 Trends in the Utilization of Emergency Department Services between 2009-2018 report to congress described efforts to discourage the overuse of Emergency Departments. 

Our mission is to analyze sport-related injuries for youth. The World Health Organization and the United Nations define 'youth' as those persons between the ages of 15 and 24 years. We aim to support hospitals by educating patients, parents, and coaches on the "non-emergency" or "inappropriate" use of E.D. resources. Our education plan wants to encourage patients, guardians, and coaches on injury sta statistics in sports in hopes of creating an injury management plan to utilize primary care services. In addition, we want to provide more support for superusers who use the E.D. visit the E.D. more frequently. We are analying into E.D. visits that were due to concussions, sprains, broken bones/fractures, dislocations in track and field, soccer, and basketball, gymnastics at school/daycare or recreation sports field. We are quiering data over a 10 year span from 2009 to 2019 from the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEIISS) Database.

## National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS) Database
For over 45 years, the CPSC has operated a statistically valid injury surveillance and follow-back system known as the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS). The primary purpose of NEISS is to collect data on consumer product-related injuries occurring in the United States. CPSC uses these data to produce nationwide estimates of product-related injuries.

NEISS is based on a nationally representative probability sample of U.S. hospitals and territories. Each participating NEISS hospital reports patient information for every emergency department visit associated with a consumer product or a poisoning. They have become an important public health research tool for CPSC, researchers, and consumers throughout the United States and worldwide. In 2000, CPSC expanded NEISS to collect data on all injuries for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention through an interagency agreement. The next major update to NEISS occurred in 2018 with seven new variables: Diagnosis_2, Other_Diagnosis_2, Body_Part_2, Product_3, Ethnicity, Alcohol_Involved, and Drug_Involved. In addition to the new variables, the maximum length of the Narrative text was increased from 142 to 400 characters. These changes were effective, starting with the treatment date of January 1, 2019.
